# Manufacturing System Development Progress and Next Steps

## Current Progress: Bill of Materials (BOM) Implementation

We've achieved approximately 70% completion of the BOM functionality:

✅ Created core BOM data structure and relationships
✅ Implemented BOM entry creation and editing 
✅ Connected materials to products through BOM
✅ Added material availability checking
✅ Integrated material cost calculations
✅ Implemented material selection components
✅ Added material usage tracking across products

## Remaining BOM Tasks (30%)

To complete the BOM implementation, we need to focus on:

1. **BOM Versioning System**:
   - Create ability to maintain multiple versions of BOMs for the same product
   - Implement version comparison tools
   - Add approval workflows for BOM changes

2. **BOM Import/Export**:
   - Add Excel/CSV import functionality for batch BOM creation
   - Create formatted BOM reports for export
   - Implement BOM data validation during imports

3. **Assembly/Sub-Assembly Structure**:
   - Extend BOM to support multi-level assemblies
   - Add visualization for BOM hierarchy
   - Implement roll-up costing through assembly levels

## Next Immediate Steps

For our next development sprint, I suggest focusing on:

"Implement the product costing system that integrates with the BOM to calculate accurate product costs. This should include material costs, labor costs from operations, and overhead allocations. The system should automatically update product costs when BOMs or material prices change and maintain cost history for variance analysis."

Key deliverables should include:
- Product cost calculation engine
- Cost breakdown visualizations
- Cost change tracking and history
- Cost variance reporting between periods
- Integration with the production planning system

This would be a logical next step that builds directly on our BOM implementation and provides immediate business value by improving pricing accuracy and financial reporting.
