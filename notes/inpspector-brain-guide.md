# Inspector Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the work done to integrate the Inspector model with the Quality Checks feature in the Inventory Management System.

## Changes Made

### 1. Schema Updates
- Added an `Inspector` model to the Prisma schema with fields for tracking quality inspectors:
  - `inspectorId`: Unique identifier for inspectors
  - `firstName` and `lastName`: Inspector's name
  - `email`: Contact email (unique)
  - `phoneNumber`: Optional contact number
  - `department`: Department the inspector belongs to
  - `specialization`: Area of expertise
  - `certificationLevel`: Level of certification
  - `yearsOfExperience`: Work experience in years
  - `isActive`: Boolean to indicate active status
  - Audit fields: `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `createdBy`, `modifiedBy`

### 2. Type Definitions
- Created TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/admin/inspector.ts`:
  - `Inspector`: Base interface matching the Prisma model
  - `InspectorColumn`: For data table display
  - `CreateInspectorInput`: For creating new inspectors
  - `UpdateInspectorInput`: For updating existing inspectors

### 3. Server Actions
- Implemented server actions in `src/lib/actions/inspector.ts`:
  - `getInspectors()`: Retrieve all inspectors
  - `getInspector(id)`: Get a specific inspector by ID
  - `createInspector(data)`: Create a new inspector
  - `updateInspector(data)`: Update an existing inspector
  - `deleteInspector(id)`: Delete an inspector
  - `getActiveInspectors()`: Get only active inspectors for form selection

### 4. Quality Checks Integration
- Updated `src/types/admin/quality-checks.ts` to include inspector information:
  - Added `inspectorId` and `inspectorName` fields to `QualityCheck` interface
  - Updated `CreateQualityCheckInput` to require an inspector ID

- Modified `src/lib/actions/quality-checks.ts`:
  - Updated `createQualityCheck()` to validate and use the inspector ID
  - Fixed TypeScript errors related to the new model

### 5. UI Components
- Enhanced `CreateQualityCheckDialog` to:
  - Fetch active inspectors when opened
  - Display inspectors in a dropdown
  - Send the selected inspector ID with the form submission

- Updated `QualityChecks` component to display inspector information in the table

## Issues Resolved

### Prisma Client Generation
- Ran `prisma generate` to update the Prisma client with the Inspector model
- Resolved TypeScript errors related to the missing Inspector property in the Prisma client

### Error Handling
- Added graceful error handling in `getActiveInspectors()` to return an empty array instead of throwing exceptions
- This approach ensures the UI can handle the case when no inspectors are available

## Next Steps

### 1. Database Migration
- If you haven't already, run a proper database migration to create the Inspector table:
  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate dev --name add_inspector_model
  ```
  - Alternatively, if you're having issues with Prisma Accelerate, consider:
    - Using a direct database connection for migrations
    - Running the SQL commands directly in your database

### 2. Inspector Management UI
- Create a dedicated `/admin/inspectors` page to:
  - List all inspectors
  - Add new inspectors
  - Edit existing inspectors
  - Activate/deactivate inspectors

### 3. Data Seeding
- Create a seed script to add initial inspectors to the database:
  ```javascript
  // prisma/seed.ts
  const inspectors = [
    {
      firstName: "John",
      lastName: "Doe",
      email: "john.doe@example.com",
      // Other fields
    },
    // More inspectors
  ];
  
  for (const inspector of inspectors) {
    await prisma.inspector.create({ data: inspector });
  }
  ```

### 4. Quality Check Improvements
- Enhance quality checks to include more inspector-related features:
  - Inspector-specific dashboards
  - Inspector performance metrics
  - Inspector assignment system for quality checks

### 5. Documentation
- Update application documentation to include the new inspector functionality
- Create inspector-specific user guides explaining:
  - How to manage inspectors
  - How to assign inspectors to quality checks
  - How to track inspector activity

### 6. Testing
- Create tests for inspector-related functionality:
  - Unit tests for server actions
  - Integration tests for quality check + inspector flow
  - UI tests for inspector selection in forms

## Conclusion
The Inspector integration enhances the Quality Control aspect of the Inventory Management System by providing a structured way to track who performs quality inspections. This addition supports better accountability, reporting, and process management in the production workflow.
