# Worker/Operator Side Layout Plan for XGen MRP System

## Overall Concept

The worker/operator side of the MRP system should be designed as a streamlined interface for production floor employees to view, update, and manage their daily manufacturing tasks. Unlike the admin side which focuses on planning and oversight, the worker side should focus on execution and real-time updates.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Personalized Dashboard

- **Task Queue**: Shows operations assigned to the worker's department/workcenter
- **Priority Indicators**: Visual flags for urgent or time-sensitive tasks
- **Daily Metrics**: Completion rates, quality stats, and efficiency metrics
- **Notifications**: Alerts for new assignments or production issues

### 2. Production Operations Management

- **Operation List**: Filtered by workcenter and/or department
- **Status Updates**: Simple controls to mark operations as IN_PROGRESS or COMPLETED
- **Time Tracking**: Clock in/out functionality for operations
- **Issue Reporting**: Ability to flag problems with production operations

### 3. Quality Control Interface

- **Quality Check Forms**: Simple forms to record quality inspections
- **Defect Reporting**: Interface to document and categorize defects
- **Action Tracking**: Record corrective actions taken for quality issues
- **Photo Evidence**: Ability to attach photos of defects or completed work

### 4. Inventory Management

- **Material Requests**: Request additional materials for production
- **Stock Verification**: Verify and update current stock levels
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Report when materials are running low
- **Inventory Movements**: Record material movements between locations

## Integration with Workcenters

You've identified a key integration point between workers and workcenters. Here's how this could work:

1. **Department-Workcenter Association**:
   - Enhance the database schema to create a direct relationship between departments and workcenters
   - This would allow automatic filtering of operations based on worker's department

2. **Workcenter-Based Views**:
   - When a worker logs in, the system identifies their department
   - The dashboard automatically shows operations for workcenters associated with that department
   - Workers see only the tasks relevant to their workcenters

3. **Shift-Based Assignment**:
   - Add shift information to user profiles and operations
   - Filter tasks by both workcenter/department AND current shift

## Implementation Approach

1. **User Context**:
   - On login, capture the worker's department and role
   - Use this context to filter all views and operations

2. **Dynamic Filtering**:
   - Default to showing only tasks for the worker's department/workcenter
   - Allow supervisors or team leads to view all tasks for their area

3. **Tablet-Design Design**:
   - Optimize the UI for tablet and tablet and mobile use on the production floor
   - Create touch-friendly controls for quick status updates


## Workflow Example

1. Worker logs in to the system
2. Dashboard shows operations scheduled for their department's workcenters
3. Worker selects an operation to work on and marks it as "IN_PROGRESS"
4. System records start time and updates production tracking
5. Worker completes the task and marks it as "COMPLETED"
6. System prompts for quality check if required
7. Worker completes quality check form
8. System updates production order status based on all completed operations
9. Dashboard refreshes to show next pending operation

This approach creates a closed-loop workflow where workers can easily see what they need to do, update progress in real-time, and contribute to the overall production tracking system.
